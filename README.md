# lang_test

This Flutter application demonstrates a simple language translation data loader. It loads JSON data from a local asset file (lang.json), which contains translations for different languages. When the user clicks the "Load JSON Data" button, the application parses the JSON data and displays it in a text box.
This project serves as a basic example for loading and displaying translation data, making it a useful starting point for more complex internationalization and localization projects.
